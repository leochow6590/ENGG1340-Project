## Part 1: Project Background

### Problem Statement: 
In the age of convenience, when everything could be easily accessed, people tend to consume beyond their abilities because their purchase power is often over-estimated. The situation is especially common among adolescents in Hong Kong because of the lack of financial status management skills, so it is extremely crucial for us to manage our financial status.. This project aims to help people manage their financial status efficiently, educates people to spend wisely, and promotes planning before spending. 

### Problem Setting:
In this project, an accounting system will be built. One set of the system can only be accessed by a single user who can add, edit and view records of income and expenses at any time. These basic functions can cut the time and effort needed for inputting tons of numbers which is originally a very tiring task if papers and pens or just your memory are what you used to use for recording. Besides inputting, searching for past records is also tedious if the quantity of records are getting large. To solve this problem, a search function is implemented in this accounting system. User can search according to amount, date, type and account. Other than recording income and expenses, people need a plan to spend money wisely. Regarding to this point, the system will offer a function of budget setting which allows user to set monthly budget. When the expenditure exceeds the budget set, user will receive an alert from the system so that user can be encouraged to plan and stick to it. Knowing that setting a budget may not be familiar to all the users, we introduced a ratio function which shows the ratio of income to expenses and this can be a reference for users. Last but not least, income and expenses are quite personal, so this system will request user to set a password in oder to protect user's privacy.

### Program Language:
C++
