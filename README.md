## Part 1: Project Background
### Problem Statement: 
Expense and income can pretty much define a person's life as money is needed everywhere. Unfortunately, money is limited, so it is extremely crucial for us to manage our financial status. Yet, managing financial status is definitely not a easy task as we have lots of expenses everyday. This project aims to help people managing their financial status efficiently by building an accounting system.

In the age of convience, when everything can be easily accessed, people tend to consumpt beyond their abilities because their purchase power is often over-estimated. The situation is especially common among adolescents in Hong Kong because of the lack of  financial status management skills. This project aims to help people manage their financial status efficiently, educates people to spend wisely, and promotes planning before spending. 
### Problem Setting:
In this project, an accounting system will be built. One set of the system can only be accessed by a single user who can add, edit and view records of income and expenses at any time. These basic functions can reduce the time and effort needed for inputting tons of numbers which is originally a very tiring task if papers and pens or just your memory are what you used to use for recording. Besides inputting, searching for past records is also tedious if the quantity of records are getting large. To solve this problem, a search function is implemented in this accounting system. User can search according to amount, date, type and account. Other than recording income and expenses, people need a plan in order to spend money wisely. Regarding to this point, the system will provide a function of budget setting which allows user to set monthly budget. When the expenditure exceeds the budget setted, user will receive an alert from the system so that user can be encouraged to plan and stick to it. Knowing that setting a budget may not be familiar to all the users, we introduced a ratio function which shows the ratio of income to expenses and this can be a reference for users. Last but not least, income and expenses are quite personal, so this system will request user to set a password in oder to protect user's privacy.
